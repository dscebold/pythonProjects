        # If they enter 1, ask for the shape values, apply the area formula, and display the answer to 2 decimal places
        # If they enter 2, ask for the shape values, apply the perimeter formula and display the answer to 2 decimal places

        # Part 4
        # Ask the user if they want to continue
        # If they enter 'n', break out of the loop and display 'PROGRAM DONE'

        # You cannot use global variables
        # Shape values must all be treated as floats
